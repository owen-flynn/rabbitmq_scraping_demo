# rabbitmq_scraping_demo
This program scrapes the IMDB top 250 movies of all time and allows the user to search by director. When the user enters the name of the director on the command line a 'message' is sent to the scraper function which then executes. The results of the search are stored in a sqlite3 database, and the result of the users search is printed to the terminal.
